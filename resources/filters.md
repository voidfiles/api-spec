## Update a Filter

Updates a specific <a href="../objects/objects.md#filter">Filter</a> object. When a filter is updated, all the streams using the filter will start using the new filter criteria. You can update a filter by PUTing an object that matches the [filter schema](../objects/objects.md#filter) with an HTTP header of ```Content-Type: application/json```. The entire filter will be replaced with new value but id's ```id``` will remain the same. Please refer to the documentation on [how to create a filter](#create-a-filter) for more information.
